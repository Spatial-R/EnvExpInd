## Environmental-Exposure-Estimation

**EnvExpInd** is a package to estimate the environmental exposure on the individual level. Compared with the traditional way which uses the average concentration of the whole monitoring sites, the `EnvExpInd` package has taken the **spatial heterogeneity** into consideration and obtained a more accurate assessment of environmental exposure on the individual level.
